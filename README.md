# Views From Mars

Ever wondered what it was like on Mars? Now you can take a front row seat at the helm of the rovers sent there by NASA!

## Description

Views from Mars was a project inspired by space exploration. There are currently, as of September 2021, 6 rovers on the planet Mars. [NASA's open API](https://api.nasa.gov/) gives us access to three of those rovers. My application accesses the Mars Rover API and retrieves images taken by these three rovers, Curiosity, Spirit, and Oportunity. The user is given the option to select the rover, specific camera and even the Earth date that the pictures were captured.

This application gives users the ability to see real images from our neighbor planet showing users that space exploration is not a science fiction dream but a reality.
