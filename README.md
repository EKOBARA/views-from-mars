## Game Discription

We are all aware of the quest for space exploration thats been on the moinds of many over mellenias. Today, we as a people are making leaps towards the goals of planing a vacation to a nearby star system (small steps but steps nonetheless). One of those steps is checking out our red neighbor. NASA has sent a few rovers over to MArs to make observations and collect data. This includes a series of photograths that are then sent over to Earth to be analized. This app uses the NASA Mars Rover API to display those photos.
